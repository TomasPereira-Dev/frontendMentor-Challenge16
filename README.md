# Where in the world?

This project is part of Frontend Mentor's catalogue of project ideas.  

The goal was to (based only on a few images) do an app that fetches data and shows it in a separate url with a fully responsive design.

## Run It Locally
>[!NOTE]
This is assuming you have both Node.js and git installed, if not, do it before start.
  
first clone this repo in your terminal

```
git clone https://github.com/TomasPereira-Dev/frontendMentor-Challenge16.git
```

Then change the folder you are into with

```
cd ./frontendMentor-Challenge16
```

Once you are there, Install everything with 

```
npm install
```

And run it.
```
npm run dev
```

## Tech I Used
I mainly used React, JavaScript and Tailwind for the styling, the data used for this project  
came from the RestCountries API.
